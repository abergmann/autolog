autolog
=======

Autolog is a version of autologout (0.35 Oct 1998)

A small utmp logging utility for Unix. Autolog aims at disconnecting idle users
based on the entries in the utmp file. It's behaviour is highly customizable
through a config file that supports the use of regexps to specify user names
and groups to act on. You should test it WITH CARE.

The original source code came from ftp.connect.org.uk:
