autolog
=======

This is a modified version of autolog. Autolog itself was branched from 
autologout in October 1998. The code was not maintained since then, so all 
modifications will be published here.

From the original autolog README:

According to David Dickson, the code originally came from the "Wizard's 
Grabbag" from the May 1990 Unix World. He ported the code essentially
unchanged. 

Description
-----------
Autolog ia a small utmp logging utility for Unix. Autolog aims at disconnecting 
idle users based on the entries in the utmp file. It's behaviour is highly 
customizable through a config file that supports the use of regexps to specify 
user names and groups to act on. You should test it WITH CARE.

The original source code came from ftp.connect.org.uk:
